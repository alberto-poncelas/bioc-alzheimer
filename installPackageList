# Function name: installPackageList
# Author: Alberto Poncelas

# When in a script we need to lead a library from Bioconductor
# which is not installed, we need to install it.
# This function takes a vector with the names of packages 
# and install the ones which have not been installed yet

# The function parameters are:
# ----packageList: a vector with the names of the packages 
#  		that need to be installed


installPackageList<-function(packageList){

	#Get installed packages
	installedPackages<-rownames(installed.packages())


	checkInstalled<-packageList %in% installedPackages

	if (! all(checkInstalled)==TRUE){
		#Get the list of uninstalled packages
		uninstalled<-packageList[checkInstalled==FALSE]

		#Prepare Bioconductor
		source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
		old.packages(repos=biocinstallRepos())
		library("Biobase")

		#install uninstalled packages
		for (pckg in uninstalled){
			biocLite(pckg)
		}

	}
	
	
	# load libraries
	for (lib in packageList){
		print(lib)
		do.call(library, list(lib))

	}
